### Task
- The task is to build a website that lets users perform searches related to Shakespeare’s
plays. For example, if a user types the search term “HENRY IV” or “sword” they would
expect to see some results.<br> 
- Also consider what happens if you have more than 10 results, how you would handle it if there were no results for a given query, and that your website would be consumed by different devices.
